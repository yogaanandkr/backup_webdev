                <h3>School Life:</h3>
            </u></i></b>
    <br>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I studied in <b><i>Mahatma Montessori school, madurai</i></b>
        till my 10th
        grade.
        Then switched to <b><i>C.E.O.A
                matriculation school, Madurai</i></b>.
        Every day in my school life was different and intresting, where I participated in various events conducted in my
        school and won prize and medals. Initially I was not able to score good marks but at the end of the year I was
        able to score the best.</p>

    <br>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Though I've wasted a lot of time during college days by
        procrastinating and playing games, which i regret now. In my current life I've made few decisions to improve my
        self in various ways and trying all the possible ways to build a good career and lifestyle. By doing so <mark>I
            feel
            every day better and hopefull.</mark> </p>
